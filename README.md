## Algorithm Practice

Generate a list of algorithm's to practice on with Tests built against to verify results. Allows ability to practice algorithm's.

### How It Works

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and yarn installed: `npm install --global yarn`

clone the repo and install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

edit the `ligma.config.js` file to isolate to algorithms wanted for practice.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    dsa: [
        "InsertionSort",
        "MergeSort",
        "Queue",
        "Stack",
        "QuickSort",
        "DijkstraList",
        "PrimsList",
    ],
};
```

create a day of algorithms, this will use the list in the `ligma.config.js`.

```bash
yarn generate
```

this will progressively create folders named

```
src/day1
src/day2
...
```

`yarn generate` will also update the `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config` to point the latest `day` folder via tspaths. This allows us to avoid updating anything for testing each day.

#### Testing

Run testing scripts to verify the algorithm works

```
yarn test
```

Note: can filter tests easily by changing command

```
npx jest Linear
```
